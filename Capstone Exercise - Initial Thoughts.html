<p>My first initial thoughts on the website are that it is taking up significant memory and space from my laptop. I enjoyed how Pickering linked the Maclean’s article so that you can link on the phrase to access the direct source. Regarding the content, when I first began to read the ‘Timeline’ portion, I noticed that he over-used the word “Indian” which based on personal research and opinion, can be used in a research context however it is offensive to Aboriginals. However, as I continued reading I noticed Pickering included the fact that ‘Aboriginal residential school’ does not exist because they were forced into it. Pickering writes “Thus, one could see an overcompensation of politically correct discussion in other provinces, assuming the term Indian is inappropriate in all contexts, even when referring to past institutions like the residential schools. While this does not give any real answers, highlighting these strange semantic differences illuminates possibilities for further historical scholarship on residential schools and public consciousness.”  I thought this was an important piece of information to include on Pickering’s part.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the pictures and graphic images that Pickering included in his website take up significant memory on my Mac, therefore it will not load. When I tried to use the website on a different browser, I notice some historical images of students in a classroom (perhaps in a residential school). However, when I re-load the website, the images disappear again.</p>
<p>So, I tried loading the website on Google Chrome and I would recommend this browser if are you trying to access the website and see the Google trends statistics that Pickering has provided as data to support his thesis.</p>
